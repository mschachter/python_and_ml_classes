So what's next? There is much to learn! Here are some suggestions:

===Git=== 

It's essential that you keep track of revisions in your code and back it up frequently. You can accomplish this using [[@http://git-scm.com/|Git]] in conjunction with [[@http://github.com|GitHub]]. Create a GitHub account for free, and then watch some tutorials on how to create a git repository from your project! Make sure your git repository is pushed to GitHub, and then you have free backups and version control!

===Biopython=== 

If you're working with DNA or protein sequences, here's a short description of how to get [[@Some Things about Biopython|Biopython]] up and running on your computer.

===Regular Expressions=== 

[[@https://docs.python.org/2/howto/regex.html|Regular Expressions]] are like a little sub-language inside of Python and many other languages that allow you to parse strings. If you're parsing files, or working with sequences, they can be very useful. Check out the tutorial in the first link, and read the documentation for the [[@https://docs.python.org/2/library/re.html|re]] module in Python to get started.

===SciPy=== 

[[@http://www.scipy.org|SciPy]] has a ton of useful things for numerical analysis and is built on top of NumPy. Check out the [[@http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-0.14.0/reference/|reference]] and see if there's stuff you would find useful.

===Networkx=== 

Are you working with graphs or networks? Check out the [[@https://networkx.github.io/|Networkx]] package!

===Working with Figures and Images=== 

Check out the [[@http://matplotlib.org/gallery.html|Matplotlib Gallery]] for some examples of the awesome things you can do with Matplotlib. Find an example you like, and then copy and paste the code onto your computer and modify it so that it does what you want it to do.

When it comes to image processing, check out [[@http://scikit-image.org/|scikit-image]] as Rachel suggested. Also consider the [[@http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/ndimage.html|SciPy ndimage]] module.

===File Input/Output=== 

You may often find yourself reading and writing files, here are some helpful links to learn more:
* [[@http://www.pythonforbeginners.com/files/reading-and-writing-files-in-python|Basic File I/O Tutorial]]
* [[@http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/io.html|File I/O in Pandas]]

===Object Oriented Programming=== 

Object Oriented Programming involves creating //objects// that encapsulate related functionality. It's a reasonably mature and widely used programming practice that you should learn more about. Here are some resources:
* [[@http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-01sc-introduction-to-electrical-engineering-and-computer-science-i-spring-2011/unit-1-software-engineering/object-oriented-programming/|MIT OpenCourseWare Object Oriented Programming Class]]
* [[@http://www.jeffknupp.com/blog/2014/06/18/improve-your-python-python-classes-and-object-oriented-programming/|Some Tutorial]]
* [[@http://code.tutsplus.com/articles/python-from-scratch-object-oriented-programming--net-21476|Another Tutorial]]
* [[@http://anandology.com/python-practice-book/object_oriented_programming.html|Yet Another Tutorial]]

===Plugging Into Campus Resources=== 

First, there is [[@http://python.berkeley.edu/]], which is chock full of resources. Consider joining the [[@https://calmail.berkeley.edu/manage/list/listinfo/py4science@lists.berkeley.edu|py4science]] mailing list and asking questions if you need help. Also, there is [[@http://dlab.berkeley.edu/|D-Lab]].
