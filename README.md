In Fall 2014, we taught a course in [Introduction to Python](https://python-biophysics-2014.wikispaces.com/)
and [Machine Learning](https://ml-biophysics2014.wikispaces.com). We used Wikispaces for the course websites. In an
effort to make the site content more accessible for people who would like to use the material for their own
classes, I copied all the raw source for each page to files. Clone this repo to get the raw source!
